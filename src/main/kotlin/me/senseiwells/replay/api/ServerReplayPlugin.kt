/**
 * This interface can be implemented to send additional packets
 * to replay recorders when a replay is started.
 *
 * This is intended for use if your mod sends custom packets to the
 * client that are usually sent after the player has logged in - these
 * would normally be recorded however if a replay is started with the
 * `/replay` command the recorder does not know this, and so they need
 * to be manually resent.
 *
 * You should add an entrypoint in your `fabric.mod.json` under
 * `server_replay` instead. For example:
 * ```json
 * {
 *   // ...
 *   "entrypoints": {
 *     "main": [
 *       // ...
 *     ],
 *     "server_replay": [
 *       "com.example.MyServerReplayPlugin"
 *     ]
 *   }
 *   // ...
 * }
 * ```
